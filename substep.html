    Substeps are easy...  you can use these comments to see how they are done.
    NOTE: you will also have to add CSS for the '.substep' class to make anything happen
    See the css/substep.css for more details.

    If it's not entirely clear, you need the forked 'impress.js' script from this project's 
    js folder to make substeps work.  Otherwise, everything else is exactly the same as 
    the upstream impress.js, so you can use that project's docs, examples, etc.

      Here is a regular impress.js step.  RTFM on impress.js to understand how this works, 
      but the TL;DR is the data-FOO properties are telling impress where to position each step.
      Adding class="step" is what lets impress.js know this is a step in your presentation

    <div id="introduction" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="0">
      <h1 class="line">impress.js - substep example</h1>
      <p>This is an example of a presentation with substeps.</p>  
      <p>Use space bar or right arrow to go to the next step. </p>
      <p>Keep pressing to reveal substeps!</p>
      <h2>Ready?<h2>
    </div>

    <!-- 
      
      This where the money gets made.  By adding class="substep" to the list elements, they
      become substeps for impress.js to navigate.  They do not understand any of the data-FOO 
      properties.  All that happens is impress.js adds 'future', 'present', 'active', and 'past'
      to the substep elements, almost exactly the way impress.js handles steps.

      The almost part is around the 'active' class.  Substeps stay 'active' one you have been 
      over them.  A normal 'step' is only active when it's 'present'.

        <li class="substep">and amaze your friends</li>
        <li class="substep">with substep goodness!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 

      Look, ma!  Another regular step!  This is here to illustrate that you can mix substeps into a
      a regular flow and the navigation makes sense.  Going backwark, the substeps will get played
      back, and the 'active' class will be removed when they return to being 'future' substeps.

      If you use this, and you like it, and you notice my pull request never makes it back into the
      the upstream impress.js, maybe just give them a little nudge.  I'd rather not maintain an
      impress.js fork going forward.

  Again, RTFM on impress.js to know everything else... like what this little script
