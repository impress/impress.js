    Substeps are easy...  you can use these comments to see how they are done.
    NOTE: you will also have to add CSS for the '.substep' class to make anything happen
    See the css/substep.css for more details.

    For general detail on using impress.js, or how it works, view the source 
    of index.html instead.

    <!-- 

      Here is a regular impress.js step.  View source on impress.js to understand how this works, 
      but the TL;DR is the data-FOO properties are telling impress where to position each step.
      Adding class="step" is what lets impress.js know this is a step in your presentation

    <div id="introduction" class="step" data-x="0" data-y="0">
      <h1 class="line">impress.js - substep example</h1>
      <p>This is an example of a presentation with substeps.</p>  
      <p>Use space bar or right arrow to go to the next step. </p>
      <p>Keep pressing to reveal substeps!</p>
      <h2>Ready?<h2>
    </div>

    <!-- 
      
      This where the money gets made.  By adding class="substep" to the list elements, they
      become substeps for impress.js to navigate.  They do not understand any of the data-FOO 
      properties.  All that happens is impress.js adds 'future', 'present', 'active', and 'past'
      to the substep elements, almost exactly the way impress.js handles steps.

      I say almost because of the 'active' class.  Substeps stay 'active' once you have been 
      over them.  A normal 'step' is only active when it's 'present'.

    <div id="can-haz" class="step" data-x="1200" data-y="1500" data-scale="1.5" data-rotate="90">
      <h1 class="line">Can Haz Substep?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li class="substep">Sure!</li>
        <li class="substep">Just add the 'substep' class</li>
        <li class="substep">and amaze your friends</li>
        <li class="substep">with substep goodness!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 

      Look, ma!  Another regular step!  This is here to illustrate that you can mix substeps into a
      a regular flow and the navigation makes sense.  Going backward, the substeps will get played
      back, and the 'active' class will be removed when they return to being 'future' substeps.

    -->
    <div id="or-not" class="step" data-x="250" data-y="3000" data-scale="2" data-rotate="180">
      <h1 class="line">These are not substeps...</h1>

        <li>so your audience is reading</li>
        <li>instead of listening.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!--

      By now you get it.  I'll just wait quietly while YOU tell ME how this step works. 
      Hint: all you have to do is add a CSS classname...

     See how easy that was?  Booya!  Feel free to give tehfoo mad props for making
     the world a better place to live.  Or just say 'hi'!  Or don't.  impress.js was
     pretty badass without substeps, and now it's probably too 'powerpointish' ;)
