**What is impress.js?**

impress.js is a javascript framework that uses the power of CSS 3 transforms and transitions in today's browsers and is inspired by the idea behind [prezi.com](https://prezi.com).

# Browser Support
The design goal for impress.js has been to showcase awesome CSS3 features as found in modern browser versions. We also use some new DOM functionality, and specifically do not use jQuery or any other JavaScript libraries, nor our own functions, to support older browsers. In general, recent versions of Firefox and Chrome are known to work well. Reportedly IE now works too.

The typical use case for impress.js is to create presentations that you present from your own laptop, with a browser version you know works well. Some people also use impress.js successfully to embed animations or presentations in a web page, however, be aware that in this some of your visitors may not see the presentation correctly, or at all.

In particular, impress.js makes use of the following JS and CSS features:

- [CSS Transitions](http://caniuse.com/#search=css%20transition)
