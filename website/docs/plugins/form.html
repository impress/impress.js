<p>Form support! Functionality to better support use of input, textarea, button... elements in a presentation.</p>
<p>This plugin does two things:</p>
<p>Set stopPropagation on any element that might take text input. This allows users to type, for example, the letter 'P' into a form field, without causing the presenter console to spring up.</p>
<p>On impress:stepleave, de-focus any potentially active element. This is to prevent the focus from being left in a form element that is no longer visible in the window, and user therefore typing garbage into the form.</p>
<p><em><strong>THIS PLUGIN REQUIRES FURTHER DEVELOPMENT</strong></em></p>
<p>TODO: Currently it is not possible to use TAB to navigate between form elements. Impress.js, and
in particular the navigation plugin, unfortunately must fully take control of the tab key,
otherwise a user could cause the browser to scroll to a link or button that's not on the current
step. However, it could be possible to allow tab navigation between form elements, as long as
they are on the active step. This is a topic for further study.</p>
