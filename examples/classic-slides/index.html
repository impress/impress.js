<!--
  This is a simple example / template impress.js slide show. The goal is to be
  easier to read for a first timer than the official and very feature rich
  demo by bartaz (http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/). It's also a very
  traditional presentation that looks like slides (square screens with bullet
  points...), again to make a first timer feel more at home. From this simple
  presentation you can then go on to more powerful impress.js presentations!
  
  This example is hopefully helpful for people that want to create both
  simple and (eventually) awesome presentations in impress.js and comfortable
  doing that directly in HTML.

        Impress.js doesn't depend on any external stylesheets. It adds all of the styles it needs for the
        presentation to work. 
        
        However, some of the `extras/` modules do come with their own CSS, and we load
        them here. You can read about each extras module separately in their directory.

    Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
    the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
    
    First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
    support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
    It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
    good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
    will also get fallback styles.
    
    When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
    be removed.
    
    Another class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step.    
-->
<body class="impress-not-supported">
<!--
    This fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.
-->
<div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>

<!--
    This is the core element used by impress.js: the wrapper for your presentation steps. 
    In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    
    data-transition-duration sets the time in microseconds that is used for the
    animation when transtitioning between slides.
    
    data-autoplay can be used to set the time in seconds, after which presentation
    automatically moves to next slide. It can also be set individually for each
    slide, but here we just set a common duration for all slides.
-->
<div id="impress" data-transition-duration="1000" data-autoplay="10">

    <!--
        Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
        of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
        the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
        
        The `id` attribute of the step element is used to identify it in the URL, but it's optional.
        If it is not defined, it will get a default value of `step-N` where N is a number of slide.
        This step is auto-assigned the id "step-1". You can also use `#step-1` in a link, to 
        point directly to this particular step.
        
        Positioning information is passed through data-* attributes.
        
        In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
        and `data-y="-1500"` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
        will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'. It will not 
        be rotated or scaled.
        
        The "step" class is what *must* be used for every "slide". In this example we also use the "slide"
        class, which adds a rectangle with some background and makes this presentation look like a traditional
        powerpoint slide show. The "slide" class is entirely optional and indeed you wouldn't use it for
        your cooler impress.js presentations.

           with the data-rel-x and data-rel-y attributes. This means the step is
           positioned relative to the foregoing step. In other words, this is

        <p>I really like the style on links in these presentations. I modified the border to be beveled, but it's mostly from <a href="http://impress.github.io/impress.js/">@bartaz' original demo</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/bartaz">@bartaz</a> is the creator of impress.js.</p>

        <p>This step here doesn't introduce anything new when it comes to data attributes, but you
        should notice in the demo that some words of this text are being animated.
        It's a very basic CSS transition that is applied to the elements when this step element is
        reached.
        </p><p>
        At the very beginning of the presentation all step elements are given the class of `future`.
        It means that they haven't been visited yet.
        </p><p>        
        When the presentation moves to given step `future` is changed to `present` class name.
        That's how animation on this step works - text moves when the step has `present` class.
        </p><p>
        Finally when the step is left the `present` class is removed from the element and `past`
        class is added.
        </p><p>
        So basically every step element has one of three classes: `future`, `present` and `past`.
        Only one current step has the `present` class.

    <!-- This last, empty "slide" is set to be very large using the data-scale attribute, 
         so that it covers all the other slides you just saw. 
         It's a common way of zooming out at the end, to show the whole presentation.
         In CSS, we set pointer-events:none to make this slide non-clickable. 
         It makes a difference at least for SVG content, such as the mermaid diagram. -->

    Add navigation-ui controls: back, forward and a select list.
    Add a progress indicator bar (current step / all steps)
    Add the help popup plugin

    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
