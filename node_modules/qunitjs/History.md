  * Update package.json
  * Partially revert af27eae841c3e1c01c46de72d676f1047e1ee375 - can't move reset around, so also don't wrap in try-catch, as the result of that is effectively swallowed. Can't output the result as the outputting is already done.
  * Add QUnit.pushFailure to log error conditions like exceptions. Accepts stacktrace as second argument, allowing extraction with catched exceptions (useful even in Safari). Remove old fail() function that would just log to console, not useful anymore as regular test output is much more useful by now. Move up QUnit.reset() call to just make that another failed assertion. Used to not make a test fail. Fixes #210
  * Update equals and same deprecations to use QUnit.push to provide correct source lines. Fixes #211
  * Add a test file for narwhal integration. Has to use print instead of console.log. Fails when an assertion fails, something about setInterval...

  * Add a simple test file to check basic nodejs integration works
  * Check for global object to find setTimeout in node
  * Fix CommonJS export by assigning QUnit to module.exports.
  * Remove the testEnvironmentArg to test(). Most obscure, never used anywhere. test() is still heavily overloaded with argument shifting, this makes it a little more sane. Fixes #172
  * Serialize expected and actual values only when test fails. Speeds up output of valid tests, especially for lots of large objects. Fixes #183
  * Fix sourceFromsStacktrace to get the right line in Firefox. Shift the 'error' line away in Chrome to get a match.
  * Fix references to test/deepEqual.js
  * In autorun mode, moduleDone is called without matching moduleStart. Fix issue #184

  * Add readme for themes
  * Fix bad global in reset()
  * Some cleanup in theme addons

  * Can't rely on outerHTML for Firefox < 11. Use cloneNode instead.
  * Merge remote branch 'conzett/master'
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Update sessionStorage support test to latest version from Modernizr, trying to setItem to avoid QUOTA_EXCEEDED_EXCEPTION

  * Allow objects with no prototype to tested against object literals.
  * Fix IE8 "Member not found" error
  * Using node-qunit port, the start/stop function are not exposed so we need to prefix any call to them with 'QUnit'. Aka: start() -> QUnit.start()
  * Remove the 'let teardown clean up globals test' - IE<9 doesn't support (==buggy) deleting window properties, and that's not worth the trouble, as everything else passes just fine. Fixes #155
  * Fix globals in test.js, part 2
  * Fix globals in test.js. ?tell wwalser to use ?noglobals every once in a while
  * Extend readme regarding release process

1.1.0 / 2011-10-11
==================

  * Fixes #134 - Add a window.onerror handler. Makes uncaught errors actually fail the testsuite, instead of going by unnoticed.
  * Whitespace cleanup
  * Merge remote branch 'trevorparscal/master'
  * Fixed IE compatibility issues with using toString on NodeList objects, which in some browsers results in [object Object] rather than [object NodeList]. Now using duck typing for NodeList objects based on the presence of length, length being a number, presence of item method (which will be typeof string in IE and function in others, so we just check that it's not undefined) and that item(0) returns the same value as [0], unless it's empty, in which case item(0) will return 0, while [0] would return undefined. Tested in IE6, IE8, Firefox 6, Safari 5 and Chrome 16.
  * Update readme with basic notes on releases
  * More whitespace/parens cleanup
  * Check if setTimeout is available before trying to delay running the next task. Fixes #160

  * Whitespace cleanup
  * Merge remote branch 'mmchaney/master'
  * Merge remote branch 'Krinkle/master'
  * Using === instead of ==
  * Added more strict array type detection for dump output, and allowed NodeList objects to be output as arrays
  * Fixes a bug where after an async test, assertions could move between test cases because of internal state (config.current) being incorrectly set
  * Simplified check for assertion count and adjusted whitespace
  * Redo of fixing issue #156 (Support Object.prototype extending environment). * QUnit.diff: Throws exception without this if Object.prototype is set (Property 'length' of undefined. Since Object.prototype.foo doesn't have a property 'rows') * QUnit.url: Without this fix, if Object.prototype.foo is set, the url will be set to ?foo=...&the=rest. * saveGlobals: Without this fix, whenever a member is added to Object.prototype, saveGlobals will think it was a global variable in this loop. --- This time using the call method instead of obj.hasOwnProperty(key), which may fail if the object has that as it's own property (touché!).
  * Handle expect(0) as expected, i.e. expect(0); ok(true, foo); will cause a test to fail

  * Update document.title status to use more robust unicode escape sequences, works even when served with non-utf-8-charset.
  * Modify document.title when suite is done to show success/failure in tab, allows you to see the overall result without seeing the tab content.
  * Merge pull request #107 from sexyprout/master
  * Set a generic font
  * Add/update headers
  * Drop support for deprecated #main in favor of #qunit-fixture. If this breaks your testsuite, replace id="main" with id="qunit-fixture". Fixes #103
  * Remove the same key as the one being set. Partial fix for #101
  * Don't modify expected-count when checking pollution. The failing assertion isn't expected, so shouldn't be counted. And if expect wasn't used, the count is misleading.
  * Fix order of noglobals check to produce correct introduced/delete error messages
  * Prepend module name to sessionStorage keys to avoid conflicts
  * Store filter-tests only when checked
  * Write to sessionStorage only bad tests
  * Moved QUnit.url() definition after QUnit properties are merged into the global scope. Fixes #93 - QUnit url/extend function breaking urls in jQuery ajax test component
  * Add a "Rerun" link to each test to replace the dblclick (still supported, for now).
  * Fixed the regex for parsing the name of a test when double clicking to filter.
  * Merge remote branch 'scottgonzalez/url'
  * Added checkboxes to show which flags are currently on and allow toggling them.
  * Retain all querystring parameters when filtering a test via double click.
  * Added better querystring parsing. Now storing all querystring params in QUnit.urlParams so that we can carry the params forward when filtering to a specific test. This removes the ability to specify multiple filters.
  * Make reordering optional (QUnit.config.reorder = false) and optimize "Hide passed tests" mode by also hiding "Running [testname]" entries.
  * Added missing semicolons and wrapped undefined key in quotes.
  * Optimize test hiding, add class on page load if stored in sessionStorage
  * Optimize the hiding of passed tests.
  * Position test results above test list, making it visible without ever having to scroll. Create a placeholder to avoid pushing down results later.
  * Don't check for existing qunit-testresult element, it gets killed on init anyway.
  * Added URL flag ?notrycatch (ala ?noglobals) for debugging exceptions. Won't try/catch test code, giving better debugging changes on the original exceptions. Fixes #72
  * Always show qunit-toolbar (if at all specified), persist checkbox via sessionStorage. Fixes #47
  * Use non-html testname for calls to fail(). Fixes #77
  * Overhaul of QUnit.callbacks. Consistent single argument with related properties, with additional runtime property for QUnit.done
  * Extended test/logs.html to capture more of the callbacks.
  * Fixed moduleStart/Done callbacks. Added test/logs.html to test these callbacks. To be extended.
  * Update copyright and license header. Fixes #61

  * Use a semaphore to synchronize stop() and start() calls. Fixes #76
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/paulirish/qunit into paulirish-master

  * Fix done() handling, check for blocking, not block property
  * Fix moduleStart/Done and done callbacks.
  * Replacing sessionStorage test with the one from Modernizr/master (instead of current release). Here's hoping it'll work for some time.
  * Updated test for availability of sessionStorage, based on test from Modernizr. Fixes #64
  * Defer test execution when previous run passed, persisted via sessionStorage. Fixes #49
  * Refactored module handling and queuing to enable selective defer of test runs.
  * Move assertions property from config to Test
  * Move expected-tests property from config to Test
  * Refactored test() method to delegate to a Test object to encapsulate all properties and methods of a single test, allowing further modifications.
  * Adding output of sourcefile and linenumber of failed assertions (except ok()). Only limited cross-browser support for now. Fixes #60
  * Drop 'hide missing tests' feature. Fixes #48
  * Adding readme. Fixes #58
  * Merge branch 'prettydiff'
  * Improve jsDump output with formatted diffs.
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Cleanup whitespace
  * Added additional guards around browser specific code and cleaned up jsDump code
  * Added guards around tests which are only for browsers
  * cleaned up setTimeout undefined checking and double done on test finish
  * fixing .gitignore
  * making window setTimeout query more consistent
  * Moved expect-code back to beginning of function, where it belongs. Fixes #52
  * Bread crumb in header: Link to suite without filters, add link to current page based on the filter, if present. Fixes #50
  * Make the toolbar element optional when checking for show/hide of test results. Fixes #46
  * Adding headless.html to manually test logging and verify that QUnit works without output elements. Keeping #qunit-fixture as a few tests actually use that.
  * Fix for QUnit.moduleDone, get rid of initial bogus log. Fixes #33
  * Pass raw data (result, message, actual, expected) as third argument to QUnit.log. Fixes #32
  * Dump full exception. Not pretty, but functional (see issue Pretty diff for pretty output). Fixes #31
  * Don't let QUnit.reset() cause assertions to run. Manually applied from Scott Gonzalez branch. Fixes #34
  * Added missing semicolons. Fixes #37
  * Show okay/failed instead of undefined. Fixes #38
  * Expose push as QUnit.push to build custom assertions. Fixes #39
  * Respect filter pass selection when writing new results. Fixes #43
  * Cleanup tests, removing asyncTest-undefined check and formatting
  * Reset: Fall back to innerHTML when jQuery isn't available. Fixes #44
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jquery/qunit
  * reset doesn't exist here - fixes #28.
  * - less css cruft, better readability - replaced inline style for test counts with "counts" class - test counts now use a "failed"/"passed" vs "pass"/"fail", shorter/more distinct selectors - pulled all test counts styling together and up (they're always the same regardless of section pass/fail state)
  * Adding .gitignore file
  * Removing diff test - diffing works fine, as the browser collapses whitespace in its output, but the test can't do that and isn't worth fixing.
  * Always synchronize the done-step (it'll set the timeout when necessary), fixes timing race conditions.
  * Insert location.href as an anchor around the header. Fixes issue #29
  * - kill double ;; in escapeHtml. oops
  * Removed html escaping from QUnit.diff, as input is already escaped, only leads to double escaping. Replaced newlines with single whitespace.
  * Optimized and cleaned up CSS file
  * Making the reset-method non-global (only module, test and assertions should be global), and fixing the fixture reset by using jQuery's html() method again, doesn't work with innerHTML, yet
  * Introducing #qunit-fixture element, deprecating the (never documented) #main element. Doesn't require inline styles and is now independent of jQuery.
  * Amending previous commit: Remove jQuery-core specific resets (will be replaced within jQuery testsuite). Fixes issue #19 - QUnit.reset() removes global jQuery ajax event handlers
  * Remove jQuery-core specific resets (will be replaced within jQuery testsuite). Fixes issue #19 - QUnit.reset() removes global jQuery ajax event handlers
  * Cleaning up rubble from the previous commit.
  * Added raises assertion, reusing some of kensnyder's code.
  * Merged kensnyder's object detection code. Original message: Streamlined object detection and exposed QUnit.objectType as a function.
  * Fixed some bad formatting.
  * Move various QUnit properties below the globals-export to avoid init becoming a global method. Fixes issue #11 - Remove 'init' function from a global namespace
  * Improved output when expected != actual: Output both only then, and add a diff. Fixes issue #10 - Show diff if equal() or deepEqual() failed
  * Expand failed tests on load. Fixes issue #8 - Failed tests expanded on load
  * Set location.search for url-filtering instead of location.href. Fixes issue #7 - Modify location.search instead of location.href on test double-click
  * Add QUnit.begin() callback. Fixes issue #6 - Add 'start' callback.
  * add css style for result (".test-actual") in passed tests
  * Fixed output escaping by using leeoniya's custom escaping along with innerHTML. Also paves the way for outputting diffs.
  * Cleanup
  * Revert "Revert part of bad merge, back to using createTextNode"
  * Revert part of bad merge, back to using createTextNode
  * Fixed doubleclick-handler and filtering to rerun only a single test.
  * Add ability to css style a test's messages, expected and actual results. Merged from Leon Sorokin (leeoniya).
  * Remove space between module name and colon
  * - removed "module" wording from reports (unneeded and cluttery) - added and modified css to make module & test names styleable
  * Logging support for  Each test can extend the module testEnvironment
  * Fixing whitespace
  * Update tests to use equal() and deepEqual() rather than the deprecated equals() and same()
  * Consistent argument names for deepEqual
  * Skip DOM part of jsDump test if using a SSJS environment without a DOM
  * Improve async testing by creating the result element before running the test, updating it later. If the test fails, its clear which test is the culprit.
  * Add autostart option to config. Set via QUnit.config.autostart = false; start later via QUnit.start()
  * Expose QUnit.config, but don't make config a global
  * Expose QUnit.config as global to make external workarounds easier
  * Merge branch 'asyncsetup'
  * Allowing async setup and teardown. Fixes https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues#issue/20
  * Always output expected and actual result (no reason not to). Fixes https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues#issue/21
  * More changes to the detection of types in jsDump's typeOf.
  * Change the typeOf checks in QUnit to be more accurate.
  * Added test for jsDump and modified its options to properly output results when document.createTextNode is used; currently tests for DOM elements cause a stackoverflow error in IEs, works fine, with the correct output, elsewhere
  * Always use jsDump to output result objects into messages, making the output for passing assertions more useful
  * Make it so that the display is updated, at least, once a second - also prevents scripts from executing for too long and causing problems.
  * added tests and patch for qunit.equiv to avoid circular references in objects and arrays
  * No reason to continue looping, we can stop at this point. Thanks to Chris Thatcher for the suggestion.
  * Use createTextNode instead of innerHTML for showing test result since expected and actual might be something that looks like a tag.
  * 'Test card' design added
  * switched green to blue for top-level pass + reduced padding
  * Bringing the QUnit API in line with the CommonJS API.
  * Explicitly set list-style-position: inside on result LIs.
  * Madness with border-radius.
  * Corrected banner styles for new class names
  * Added rounded corners and removed body rules for embedded tests
  * Resolving merge conflicts.
  * added colouring for value summary
  * adding some extra text colours
  * added styles for toolbar
  * added new styles
  * IE 6 and 7 weren't respecting the CSS rules for the banner, used a different technique instead.
  * Went a bit further and made extra-sure that the target was specified correctly.
  * Fixed problem where double-clicking an entry in IE caused an error to occur.
  * Path for https://dev.jquery.com/ticket/5426 - fix the microformat test result
  * Fixed test() to use 'expected' 2nd param
  * Remove the named function expressions, to stop Safari 2 from freaking out. Fixes #5.
  * Each test can extend the module testEnvironment
  * Extra test for current test environment
  * Make the current testEnvironment available to utility functions
  * typeOf in QUnit.jsDump now uses QUnit.is
  * hoozit in QUnit.equiv now uses QUnit.is
  * Properly set label attributes.
  * Some minor tweaks to RyanS' GETParams change.
  * left a console.log in :(
  * Took into account a fringe case when using qunit with testswarm. Trying to run all the tests with the extra url params from testswarm would make qunit look for a testsuite that did not exist
  * need to set config.currentModule to have correct names and working filters
  * Support logging of testEnvironment
  * async tests aren't possible on rhino
  * Fixed a missing QUnit.reset().
  * The QUnit. prefix was missing from the uses of the start() method.
  * Merged lifecycle object into testEnvironment
  * "replacing totally wrong diff algorithm with a working one" Patch from kassens (manually applied).
  * fixing jslint errors in test.js
  * Fixed: testDone() was always called with 0 failures in CommonJS mode
  * Fixed: moduleDone() was invoked on first call to module()
  * Added a new asyncTest method - removes the need for having to call start() at the beginning of an asynchronous test.
  * Added support for expected numbers in the test method.
  * Fixed broken dynamic loading of tests (can now dynamically load tests and done still works properly).
  * Simplified the logic for calling 'done' and pushing off new tests - was causing too many inconsistencies otherwise.
  * Simplified the markup for the QUnit test test suite.
  * Realized that it's really easy to handle the case where stop() has been called and then an exception is thrown.
  * Added in better logging support. Now handle moduleStart/moduleDone and testStart/testDone. Also make sure that done only fires once at the end.
  * Made it so that you can reset the suite to an initial state (at which point tests can be dynamically loaded and run, for example).
  * Re-worked QUnit to handle dynamic loading of additional code (the 'done' code will be re-run after additional code is loaded).
  * Removed the old SVN version stuff.
  * Moved the QUnit source into a separate directory and updated the test suite/packages files.
  * Added in CommonJS support for exporting the QUnit functionality.
  * Missing quote from package.json.
  * Fixed trailing comma in package.json.
  * Added a CommonJS/Narwhal package.json file.
  * Accidentally reverted the jsDump/equiv changes that had been made.
  * Hide the filter toolbar if it's not needed. Also exposed the jsDump and equiv objects on QUnit.
  * Retooled the QUnit CSS to be more generic.
  * Renamed the QUnit files from testrunner/testsuite to QUnit.
  * Expose QUnit.equiv and QUnit.jsDump in QUnit.
  * Moved the QUnit test directory into the QUnit directory.
  * Reworked the QUnit CSS (moved jQuery-specific stuff out, made all the other selectors more specific).
  * Removed the #main reset for non-jQuery code (QUnit.reset can be overwritten with your own reset code).
  * Moved the QUnit toolbar inline.
  * Switched to using a qunit- prefix for special elements (banner, userAgent, and tests).
  * Missed a case in QUnit where an element was assumed to exist.
  * QUnit's isSet and isObj are no longer needed - you should use same instead.
  * Make sure that QUnit's equiv entity escaping is enabled by default (otherwise the output gets kind of crazy).
  * Refactored QUnit, completely reorganized the structure of the file. Additionally made it so that QUnit can run outside of a browser (inside Rhino, for example).
  * Removed some legacy and jQuery-specific test methods.
  * Added callbacks for tests and modules. It's now possible to reproduce the full display of the testrunner without using the regular rendering.
  * QUnit no longer depends upon rendering the results (it can work simply by using the logging callbacks).
  * Made QUnit no longer require jQuery (it is now a standalone, framework independent, test runner).
  * Reverted the noglobals changed from QUnit - causing chaos in the jQuery test suite.
  * qunit: removed noglobals flag, instead always check for globals after teardown; if a test has to introduce a global "myVar", use delete window.myVar in teardown or at the end of a test
  * qunit: don't child selectors when IE should behave nicely, too
  * qunit: improvement for the test-scope: create a new object and call setup, the test, and teardown in the scope of that object - allows you to provide test fixtures to each test without messing with global data; kudos to Martin Häcker for the contribution
  * qunit: added missing semicolons
  * qunit: fixed a semicolon, that should have been a comma
  * QUnit: implemented error handling for Opera as proposed by #3628

  * qunit: wrap name of test in span when a module is used for better styling
  * qunit: auto-prepend default mark (#header, #banner, #userAgent, #tests) when not present
  * Landing some changes to add logging to QUnit (so that it's easier to hook in to when a test finishes).
  * Added checkbox for hiding missing tests (tests that fail with the text 'missing test - untested code is broken code')
  * qunit: eol-style:native and mime-type
  * HTML being injected for the test result wasn't valid HTML.
  * qunit: setting mimetype for testsuite.css
  * qunit: update to Ariel's noglobals patch to support async tests as well
  * Landing Ariel's change - checks for global variable leakage.
  * qunit: run module-teardown in its own synchronize block to synchronize with async tests (ugh)
  * qunit: same: equiv - completely refactored in the testrunner.
  * testrunner.js:     - Update equiv to support Date and RegExp.     - Change behavior when comparing function:         - abort when in an instance of Object (when references comparison failed)         - skip otherwise (like before)
  * qunit: code refactoring and cleanup
  * QUnit: update equiv to latest version, handling multiple arguments and NaN, see http://philrathe.com/articles/equiv
  * QUnit: cleanup, deprecating compare, compare2 and serialArray: usage now throws an error with a helpful message

  * qunit: use window.load to initialize tests, allowing other code to run on document-ready before starting to run tests
  * qunit: allow either setup or teardown, instead of both or nothing
  * qunit: make everything private by default, expose only public API; removed old timeout-option (non-deterministic, disabled for a long time anyway); use local $ reference instead of global jQuery reference; minor code cleanup (var config instead of _config; queue.shift instead of slice)
  * qunit: added support for module level setup/teardown callbacks
  * qunit: modified example for equals to avoid confusion with parameter ordering
  * qunit: added id/classes to result element to enable integration with browser automation tools, see http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit#Integration_into_Browser_Automation_Tools
